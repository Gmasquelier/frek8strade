# frek8strade

Small project to deploy multiple freqtrade bots from a common base.

Check configuration files generated by kustomize:
``` 
kubectl kustomize ./
```

Apply configuration to your cluster:
``` 
kubectl apply -k ./
```

From base/ingress.yaml, change the HTTP route "parentRefs" in accordance to your cluster Gateway API. Here "traefik" is been used.
